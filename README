SCRAMBLER (part of the StudioBlood LADSPA plugin package, hence the sb_ prefix)
-------
July 29, 2009. Tyler Hayes. Portland, OR.

Scrambler is an audio effect plugin using LADPSA (Linux Audio Developers Simple
Plugin API).  It basically takes each block of samples and reorders them randomly.

It is written in C because the API is in C, and licensed under the GPL v3,
because it's an easy choice when one doesn't want to take the time to
research a bunch of licenses to find 'the right one'.

Thanks to Richard Furse and company for creating ladspa.h, and thanks to Bart
Massey at Portland State University for suggesting LADSPA plugins as a good
open source project to work on.  He also helped me get the correct flags in
the Makefile in order to produce a working shared object file.
Also thanks to Richard Brent for his uniform random number generator.

I am still a student programmer at the time of this writing, so some of the comments
in the source code are detailed and directed at the beginner as well.  Hopefully
the comments will be beneficial to those who were like me in learning the API,
and not too annoying for the pro's out there.

HOW TO INSTALL
--------------
To install, make sure the LADSPA_PATH variable in the Makefile is correct to your
environment, and just run (as root) 'make install'.  You can also run 'make uninstall'
(again, as root) to get rid of the plugin.
